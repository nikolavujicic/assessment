## **Development Decisions**
- This project is a simple React application for managing tasks and checking the weather. 
- It includes routing, authentication, and basic CRUD operations.

## ** Regarding technical decisions, I have primarily followed the requirements of the task.**

- Context API + useReducer:
I chose this combination as it provides a lightweight state management solution for handling global component data without introducing unnecessary complexity.

- Styled Components:
This CSS-in-JS solution allows for scoped, reusable, and manageable styles directly within components, improving maintainability and scalability.

- React Query:
React Query simplifies data fetching and comes with additional functionalities like caching, re-fetching, and query invalidation, making it a robust choice for managing asynchronous operations.

These tools and approaches allowed me to build a clean, maintainable, and scalable application within the project scope.
